### What I learned

I learnt how to center a div box properly and to float images well.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<img src="../images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="image product mobile version" class="img-prod">

```
```css
.img-prod {
    max-width: 100%;
    border-radius: 15px 15px 0 0;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
